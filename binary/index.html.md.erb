<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Use the binary buildpack for running arbitrary binary web servers.

## <a id='pushing_apps'></a> Push an App ##

Unlike most other Cloud Foundry buildpacks, you must specify the binary 
buildpack to use it when staging your binary file.
On a command line, use `cf push APP-NAME` with the `-b` option to specify the 
buildpack.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my_app -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack.git
</pre>

You can provide Cloud Foundry with the shell command to execute your binary in
the following two ways:

* **Procfile**: In the root directory of your app, add a `Procfile` that
specifies a `web` task:

```yaml
web: ./app
```
* **Command line**: Use `cf push APP-NAME` with the `-c` option:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my_app -c './app' -b binary-buildpack
</pre>

## <a id='compiling'></a> Compile your Binary ##
Cloud Foundry expects your binary to bind to the port specified by the `PORT`
environment variable.

The following example in [Go](https://golang.org/) binds a binary to the PORT 
environment variable:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "os"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %s", "world!")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":"+os.Getenv("PORT"), nil)
}
```

Your binary should run without any additional runtime dependencies on the
cflinuxfs2 or lucid64 root filesystem (rootfs).
Any such dependencies should be statically linked to the binary.

To boot a docker container running the cflinuxfs2 filesystem, run the following
command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ docker run -it cloudfoundry/cflinuxfs2 bash
</pre>

To boot a docker container running the lucid64 filesystem, run the following
command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ docker run -it cloudfoundry/lucid64 bash
</pre>

To compile the above Go application on the rootfs, golang must be installed. `apt-get install golang` and `go build app.go` will produce an `app` binary.

When deploying your binary to Cloud Foundry, use `cf push` with the `-s` option to specify the root filesystem it should run against.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my_app -s (cflinuxfs2|lucid64)
</pre>

To run docker on Mac OS X, we recommend [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/).

## <a id='bosh_trusted_cert'></a>BOSH Configured Custom Trusted Certificate Support ##

Your platform operator can configure the platform to [add the custom certificates into the application container](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/trusted-system-certificates.html).
The custom trusted certificates will be added to the `/etc/ssl/certs` directory and can be used by binary applications.

Foundry, see the [binary-buildpack GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack).

You can find current information about this buildpack on the binary buildpack
[release page](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack/releases) in 
GitHub.
